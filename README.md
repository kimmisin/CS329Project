# CS329Project: UT Austin Guide for Students

#### [Phase 4 Requirements] (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/2021spring/329E.Project.Phase4.html)
-The interior pages should have a title and a logo, which should be a link to the home page.\
-The content should be presented in short paragraphs and/or bulleted sentences.\
-The main navigation bar should be consistent across all pages. You may place a non-working link for the current page in the navigation bar.\
-You can have links to other content areas. If you do not have the content ready these links should point to a single blank page.\
\
At this phase, the majority of the main textual content and images should be there. Your interior pages should have all the content of your website, but perhaps only in abridged form. You should have working links from these pages to other content areas.\
\
You must have at least two JavaScript applications. One could be some type of form validation; the second should be a DHTML application. I also encourage you to use jQuery somewhere in your applications.\
\
\
**All items will be in the project folder with no subfolders for the sake of not using specific URLs
[Phase 5 Requirements] (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/2021spring/329E.Project.Phase5.html)
At this point, you should have all of the client-side programming completed. You should be working on the server side, but not necessarily using the SQL database yet. The deliverables for this stage are: \
\
-You must complete all form processing using PHP.\
-You must have a PHP application that sets and reads cookies in a meaningful way.\
-You must have a PHP application that maintains state in transactions somehow.\

In anticipation of your final project, here is (once again) a reminder of the technical features that you must include in your website.\
\
-HTML pages that validate\
-Cascading Style Sheets that validate\
-JavaScript front end form verification\
-Dynamic HTML features\
-PHP script to process form data\
-Maintain state in transactions\
-Set and read cookies\
-MySQL database backend\
-PHP interface to the MySQL database\
-Annotated links to other related web sites\
-Links to audio and video files\
-AJAX application\

After you complete the PHP scripts, add a link to the top of your table on the server, and label it "Project Phase 5". As always, use the HTML and CSS validators, and look at your page through multiple browsers.
