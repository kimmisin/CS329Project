# CS329Project: UT Austin Guide for Students

#### [Phase 4 Requirements] (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/2021spring/329E.Project.Phase4.html)
-The interior pages should have a title and a logo, which should be a link to the home page.\
-The content should be presented in short paragraphs and/or bulleted sentences.\
-The main navigation bar should be consistent across all pages. You may place a non-working link for the current page in the navigation bar.\
-You can have links to other content areas. If you do not have the content ready these links should point to a single blank page.\
\
At this phase, the majority of the main textual content and images should be there. Your interior pages should have all the content of your website, but perhaps only in abridged form. You should have working links from these pages to other content areas.\
\
You must have at least two JavaScript applications. One could be some type of form validation; the second should be a DHTML application. I also encourage you to use jQuery somewhere in your applications.\
\

**All items will be in the project folder with no subfolders for the sake of not using specific URLs
