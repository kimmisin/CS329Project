# CS329Project: UT Austin Guide for Students

[Phase 6 Requirements] (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/2021spring/329E.Project.Phase6.html) \
For your final phase, everything should be working, and there should be substantial content in each of the sections in your web page. There should not be any filler text like Lorem Ipsum. \
\
(X) HTML pages that validate \
(X) Cascading Style Sheets that validate \
(X) JavaScript front end form verification \
(X) Dynamic HTML features \
(X) PHP script to process form data \
( ) MySQL database back end \
( ) PHP interface to the MySQL database \
(?) Maintain state in transactions \
(X) Set and read cookies \
(X) Annotated links to other related web sites \
( ) Include AJAX application \
( ) Include audio and / or video files \
( ) You must store usernames and passwords in an SQL database, not in a plain ASCII file. \
( ) You must not pass passwords in the URL (as with a GET request) where users could see them. \
( ) Be sure to use real_escape_string() as appropriate to prevent SQL injection. \
\
Your site must be aesthetically pleasing. Your site MUST have a professional look and feel. All forms (including login and registration) should be intuitive and pleasing to the eye. Projects that do not meet our subjective criteria WILL be penalized. \
\
Ensure that EVERY member of your team has a personal copy of all of the files of the final project stored on the server. Add a link to the top of your table in your index.html file on the server, and label it "Final Project Phase 6". This is for your own protection as well as our convenience. \
\
You are also expected to present your website to the class. Specific days and times will be assigned randomly the week before presentations begin. Note that the presentation will take place before the due date of your final release, so you can continue to work on your project after the presentation. \
\
You will have roughly 10 minutes to introduce your team and topic, launch your website, and demonstrate as many features of your website as you can within your time limit. Plan to walk through all working paths, including login/registration, and show all pages in your website. You are allowed to pre-populate data files with fake (or real) users, profile data, etc., so that you don't have to show empty pages. All team members should plan to be present and participate in the final presentation unless explicitly excused by Dr. Bulko. \
\
As always, use the HTML and CSS validators, and look at your page through multiple browsers. \
\

\
Grading Guidelines \
\
There is no formal rubric for grading your final project, since everyone's website can (and should) look and behave vastly different from everyone else's. However, these are the some of the things we will be looking at as we grade: \
\
Presentation: Was it well-organized? Did everyone on the team participate in the presentation and/or demo? Did the demo focus on the important technological features of the site, or just the content? Was the amount of functionality expected through Project Phase 5 presented and working properly? (Note that this is still a work in progress, especially on the earlier presentation days, so not everything is expected to be finished yet.) \
Document: As described above. Was the document summarizing your use of Web technologies turned in on Canvas in time, and did it contain the information requested?
The Website: Was it completed on time? Are all of the required technologies used in the way it was expected to be used? Did the website fail or crash unexpectedly while being tested? Does the website meet the expectations outlined in all of the design documents posted on the course website? Does the website look professional and attractive, or does it just deliver function without style? \
The above components will be roughly weighted 10% presentation, 10% document, and 80% website. Clearly, the website itself is the key deliverable; however, the idea is you should not expect to get more than a 90% if you fail to turn in the technology summary document, or if you don't participate in the presentation (unless you were explicitly excused by me personally).\
