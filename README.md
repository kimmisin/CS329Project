# CS329Project: UT Austin Guide for Students

[Phase 5 Requirements] (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bulko/2021spring/329E.Project.Phase5.html) \
At this point, you should have all of the client-side programming completed. You should be working on the server side, but not necessarily using the SQL database yet. The deliverables for this stage are: \
\
-You must complete all form processing using PHP.\
-You must have a PHP application that sets and reads cookies in a meaningful way.\
-You must have a PHP application that maintains state in transactions somehow.\

In anticipation of your final project, here is (once again) a reminder of the technical features that you must include in your website.\
\
-HTML pages that validate\
-Cascading Style Sheets that validate\
-JavaScript front end form verification\
-Dynamic HTML features\
-PHP script to process form data\
-Maintain state in transactions\
-Set and read cookies\
-MySQL database backend\
-PHP interface to the MySQL database\
-Annotated links to other related web sites\
-Links to audio and video files\
-AJAX application\
\
After you complete the PHP scripts, add a link to the top of your table on the server, and label it "Project Phase 5". As always, use the HTML and CSS validators, and look at your page through multiple browsers.\

**All items will be in the project folder with no subfolders for the sake of not using specific URLs
